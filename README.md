**MENTALIA**

Mentalia, the final project of Ironhack's bootcamp, was developed in collaboration with Francisco Pazos Rey. It's an innovative initiative centered on mental well-being, featuring a mood tracker to monitor emotions, facilitating access to psychologists, and providing a community platform for sharing ideas and experiences among users. This comprehensive project was developed within a two-week timeframe.

In the future, we will implement the option for psychologists to register, where appropriate checks on the professional's credentials will be conducted. Psychologists will have the option to unify and keep a record of all their patients within the platform.

**Technologies used**

Frontend: React, Bootstrap

Backend: Express, Node.js, MongoDB
